# Factory Reset (Device-Dependent)

The website can issue a **factory reset command**, but support depends on the device.

- Only works if:
  - The OEM supports factory reset via MDM
  - The device allows MDM-initiated reset
- **Not supported on emulators**
- Some physical devices do support this feature

This action fully wipes the device and should only be used when explicitly required.
