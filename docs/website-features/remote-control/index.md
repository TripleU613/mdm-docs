# Remote Control (Screen Viewing)

The website provides a **remote control / screen viewing** feature.

- Works similarly to a screen copy or AnyDesk-style session
- Behavior depends heavily on the device and Android OS version

## Connection Behavior

Depending on the device:
- The session may be auto-accepted
- The user may need to manually accept the request
- The OS may prompt the user to select a single app to share
- In some cases, the feature may not work at all

## Limitations

- Stability varies by device
- Stream is **low latency but low quality**
- Feature is known to be **buggy** on some devices
- Best effort stability is applied

If the feature does not work:
- Verify that the device supports **WebRTC**

Use this feature with care.
