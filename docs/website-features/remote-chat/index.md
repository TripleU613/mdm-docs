# Remote Chat (Admin ↔ Device)

The **Remote Chat** feature lets the **device owner** and the **admin** chat in real time.

## Where it lives

- **Website:** Remote Control → **Chat** tab
- **Android:** Lock screen → **Chat with admin**

## How it works

- Chat is **per device**
- The **device ID** is the client
- The **device owner email** is the account contact
- Admin can reply even if the device user is offline

## Start a conversation

1. Add a **Subject**
2. Add the **first message**
3. Chat opens immediately

## Features

- **Typing indicators**
- **Read status**
- **Attachments** (max **50 MB**)
- **Export chat** (TXT / JSON)
- **Delete chat**

## Notifications

When the admin replies, the device receives a **system notification**:

- Title: **New message from admin**
- Body: the message text or attachment name

## Retention

Messages are **auto‑deleted after 10 days**.

---

If the device cannot chat, verify that **Remote Access** is enabled for that device.
