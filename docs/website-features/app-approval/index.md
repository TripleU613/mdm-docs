# Remote App Approval

Although app approval exists in the MDM app, the website provides a convenient way to manage it remotely.

- Approve detected apps
- Block or leave apps in a pending state
- Used in combination with the **Detect New Apps** feature

This makes remote app governance significantly easier.
