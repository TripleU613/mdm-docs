# Website Introduction

Before using the website to control a device, it is important to understand how access works and what is required to get started.

## Overview

Remote control of a device through the website requires an active plan. Once a valid plan is applied to a device, the device becomes accessible through the website for remote management.

## Available Plans

There are **three plans** that enable website-based control of a device:

- **$2 per month per device subscription**
- **VPN plan (monthly)**
- **VPN plan (three-month term)**

If you select **any** of these plans, you will be granted access to the website for remotely controlling the associated device.

## Getting Started

1. Select and complete payment for one of the available plans.
2. After payment is completed, access is **not immediate**.
   - It typically takes **30 seconds to 1 minute** for the database to refresh.
   - Refresh the website after payment to gain remote access.
3. Once the refresh is complete, the device should appear as remotely accessible on the website.

## Device Communication Delay

In some cases, the device itself may take additional time to communicate with the database.

- If the device appears unresponsive or is not communicating correctly:
  - This usually means the device has not successfully contacted the database.
  - Restart the device to force a fresh connection.
- After restarting, the device should establish communication and function correctly with the website.

This completes the basic setup and initial access process.

## Cancelling a Website Subscription

> This section applies **only to website subscriptions**.  
> It **does not apply to VPN subscriptions**.

To cancel a website subscription:

1. Go to the **Home** tab.
2. In the **top-right corner**, select **Cancel**.
3. The subscription is cancelled **immediately**.

### Important Notes

- Cancellation takes effect right away.
- You will **instantly lose remote access** to the device.
- No grace period is applied after cancellation.

Use this option carefully, especially if you still need remote management access to the device.
