# Website Categories

The **Website Categories** tabs (there may be more than one) control **Chrome browser behavior**.

These tabs define:
- Which website categories are allowed
- Which categories are blocked

Together, these category tabs control **nearly all Chrome traffic**.

## Content Controls

Additional filtering options include:

- **Block images**
  - Includes blocking by skin tone
- **Block bad words**
  - If multiple bad words are detected, the content is progressively blocked ("starved out")

> Note: Many websites are **not yet categorized**.
