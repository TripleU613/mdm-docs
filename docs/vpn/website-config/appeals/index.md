# Appeals Tab

If a website is blocked and the user submits an appeal from the device:

- The appeal appears in the **Appeals** tab

Available actions:
- **Approve by category** (allows all sites in that category)
- **Approve site only** (allows only the specific site)

This allows fine-grained exceptions without opening an entire category.
