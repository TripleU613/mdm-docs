# Uncategorized Websites & Categorization Requests

When a user visits an **uncategorized website** on the device:

- The user can select **Request Categorization**
- The request appears in the **Help Categorize** tab on the website

## Help Categorize Tab

This tab delegates categorization decisions to users/admins:

- Decide whether the site is allowed or blocked
- Assign the appropriate category

User participation is important, as categorization data cannot be purchased externally.
