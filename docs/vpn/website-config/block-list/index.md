# Block List (App Allowlist)

The **Block List** tab contains a predefined list of apps that are made *kosher* (allowed) through the VPN.

Examples include:
- MoveIt
- Waze
- WhatsApp
- Gmail
- Play Store
- Spotify
- Google Maps
- Gboard

Each app includes a short description explaining what it enables.

- Toggle an app **ON** to allow it through the VPN
- Toggle **OFF** to block it

Once enabled, the app should work as expected through the VPN.
