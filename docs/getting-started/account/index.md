# Account Setup

## Signing In or Creating an Account

After accepting the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, the app displays the **Sign In** screen.

You can either **sign in to an existing account** or **create a new account**.

## Creating an Account

To create a new account, you must provide the following information:

<details>
<summary>Image</summary>

![Create account screen](/assets/create-account.png){ width=320 }

</details>

- **Full name**
- **Phone number**
- **Email address**
- **Account password**
- **Confirm password**
- **App PIN**

### Account Password vs App PIN

- **Account password**
  - Used to access your account on:
    - Other devices
    - The web portal
  - Allows you to manage and control devices associated with your account

- **App PIN**
  - Used to unlock and access the MDM app locally
  - Works even when the device is offline

After completing all fields, submit the form to create your account and continue setup.

### Email Verification (OTP)

After you tap **Create Account**, an OTP is sent to your email inbox. Check **Primary** or **Spam**, then enter the OTP in the app to verify your account and continue.

<details>
<summary>Image</summary>

![Login screen](/assets/login.png){ width=320 }

</details>

- **Email address**
- **Account password**
- **App PIN**

Once entered, tap **Sign In** to continue.

## Device Slot Limitation

Each account includes **one free device slot**.

Important notes:

- If you have already used your free device slot, signing in on a **new device** will require purchasing an additional device slot.
- This applies even if:
  - Setup was not completed previously
  - You are returned to the sign-in screen on a different device
- Re-signing into the **same device** does consume an additional slot.

If you see the sign-in screen again on a new device, that device will count as a new slot.

## Hidden Action: Clearing Device Owner

On the **Create Account**, **Login**, and **Permissions** screens, there is a hidden option:

<details>
<summary>Image</summary>

![Clear device owner action](/assets/clear-device-owner.png){ width=320 }

</details>

- Tap the **avatar image** at the top of the screen (the animated character).
- This clears the **Device Owner** state from the device.

This is useful if:
- The device is stuck with Device Owner set
- You do not currently have access to an account
- You need to restart setup cleanly

> This action is intentionally hidden and should be used only for recovery scenarios.

## Resetting a Forgotten Password

</details>

1. Enter your **email address** on the password reset option.
2. Tap **Submit**.
3. You will receive your password via email.

After resetting your password, return to the sign-in screen and log in normally.
